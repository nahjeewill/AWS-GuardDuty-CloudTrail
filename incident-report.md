# SOC Incident Report â€“ AWS GuardDuty Threat Monitoring Simulation

**Incident ID:** AWS-GD-2025-001  
**Date/Time Detected:** 2025-08-04 17:14 UTC  
**Reported by:** AWS GuardDuty  
**Severity Level:** Low  

---

## 1. Executive Summary
During a controlled AWS GuardDuty simulation exercise, suspicious activity was detected involving an IAM user named `malicious-user-simulation`.  
The user disabled S3 Block Public Access on a bucket named `nahjeewill-testing` using the `PutBucketPublicAccessBlock` API call.  
This action could have exposed the bucket contents to the public if not remediated.  
CloudTrail logs confirmed the unauthorized configuration change and associated it with a remote IP address in Oklahoma City, United States.

## 3. Timeline of Events

| Timestamp (UTC) | Event Description |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 17:07:44 | `malicious-user-simulation` disables S3 Block Public Access on `nahjeewill-testing` |
| 17:14:24 | GuardDuty generates finding `Policy:S3/BucketBlockPublicAccessDisabled` |
| 22:07:44 | CloudTrail logs confirm API call from IP `156.110.24.142` (Oklahoma City, US) |
| 22:10:46 | IAM activity logs show group and role modifications |

## 4. Investigation Summary
Analysis in AWS CloudTrail correlated the GuardDuty finding with specific API calls:
- **API Call:** `PutBucketPublicAccessBlock`
- **Bucket Affected:** `nahjeewill-testing`
- **Effective Permission After Action:** PUBLIC
- **Actor:** IAM User `malicious-user-simulation`
- **Caller Type:** Remote IP (`156.110.24.142`)
- **Organization ASN:** ONENET-AS-1 (Oklahoma Network for Education Enrichment)

---

## 5. Impact Assessment
If this had occurred in a production environment, the disabling of S3 Block Public Access could have exposed sensitive or confidential data to the public internet.  
The IAM user had `AdministratorAccess` privileges, meaning further privilege abuse was possible.

---

## 6. Containment and Remediation
- Re-enabled Block Public Access for the S3 bucket.
- Deleted IAM user `malicious-user-simulation`.
- Rotated all access keys associated with affected accounts.
- Enforced MFA for all IAM users.
- Applied least privilege principle to IAM permissions.

---

## 7. Lessons Learned
- AWS GuardDuty effectively detects unauthorized or risky configuration changes.
- CloudTrail is essential for validating detection findings and pinpointing actor details.
- S3 public access settings must be locked down with service control policies or IAM guardrails to prevent accidental or intentional exposure.
