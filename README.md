# AWS-GuardDuty-CloudTrail
Cloud Threat Monitoring Simulation
# AWS CloudTrail + GuardDuty Threat Monitoring

## Objective
Simulate suspicious AWS account activity, detect threats with GuardDuty, and investigate using CloudTrail logs.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Cloud-based threat detection
- Log analysis and correlation
- IAM misconfiguration identification
- SOC-style incident reporting

## Tools
AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty, IAM, CloudWatch, Athena

## Steps
1. Enabled CloudTrail and GuardDuty
2. Created over-permissioned IAM user
3. Simulated suspicious API calls
4. Reviewed GuardDuty findings
5. Investigated events in CloudTrail
6. (Optional) Queried logs using Athena
7. Documented findings in an incident report

## Outcome
Successfully detected and investigated simulated threats, reinforcing SOC investigation skills in a cloud environment.
